## Overview

`create-ex` is designed to kickstart your Express projects with best practices built in. It consists of:

- **TypeScript**
- **Modular Structure:** Clear separation of routes, controllers, services, and more.
- **Optional Integrations:** Choose from Prisma (with multiple database support), Socket.IO, ESLint, and more.
- **Automated Setup:** Quickly initialize Git, install dependencies, and get started.

It's a CLI tool to streamline the setup of a modular Express API application. Every component is optional, and the final template is generated based on your specific needs.
We provide our recommendations for best practices, but ultimately, the decisions are yours.

### npm

```
